# Time Zone Converter

# Version: 220607

This a self-contained HTML page (i.e. does not require network access beyond the initial download) that can be used to see the current date, time, UTC offset, and time zone in a number of pre-configured locations (i.e. a world clock), and convert any date and time from any of the locations to all others.

Time zone changes for individual locations, such as for daylight saving time, are supported and natively via the browser and operating system.

Historic and future changes to time zone changes (e.g. the dates that daylight saving time starts or end changing, or [daylight saving time being made permanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Protection_Act)) are supported, as long as the browser and operating system are kept up to date.

The top table shows the current date and time in each location. Your current time zone will be highlighted in blue.

To convert the date and time from one location to all others:

1. Select the location you want to convert from by clicking or tapping its button
2. Enter the the date using the date picker
3. Enter the time using the time picker
4. Click the Convert button
5. The location you are converting from will be highlighted in blue
6. Locations can be removed from a conversion by clicking the cross on the right-hand side of the location’s row
7. The entire conversion can be removed by clicking the cross on the right-hand side of the table header
8. You can show as many conversions on the page as your browser’s resources allow
